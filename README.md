# MoeBot

Hi, I'm Alex and this is my personal Discord bot with functions I designed to be of use for me and my friends.

## Installation Instructions

Clone it my dude:

  `git clone https://github.com/AlexanderFengFeng/MoeBot.git`

or if you're Mr. Alexander Feng himself:

  `git clone git@github.com:AlexanderFengFeng/MoeBot.git`

That's pretty much it my dude.

## Usage and functions

Since the bot is primarily for me and my friends, most of its functions are specific to the popular game, Fortnite. The functions pull data from an API (www.fnbr.co or www.fortnitetracker.com) and presents it to the user in a readable format.

### Commands

`!m info` - Gets general info on the bot.

`!m help` - Displays commands the bot takes.

`!m fn store` - Displays the current Fortnite store.

`!m fn item {itemname}` - Displays the queried item along with its price.

`!m fn stats {PC_playername}` - Displays stats for a PC player on Fortnite.

`!m fn challenges` - Displays info on the current week of Fortnite Battle Pass challenges.

`!m yeet` - YEET!
